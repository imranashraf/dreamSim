Short Term
==========
*	check the performance metric calculations e.g. wasted_area, to see if it is being updated as required
*	do experimentation with various setups and see the trend

*	introduce two simple policy as discussed earlier according to the order of allocation-configuration
*	introduce the polices such as 
		-	greedy policy : which will try to schedule as soon as possible
		-	load balanced policy:	which will try to balance the load among nodes
		-	
		



Long Term
=========
*	node, task, configs should be separte classes containing their functions etc in them
