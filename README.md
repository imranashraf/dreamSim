DReAMSim (Dynamic Reconfigurable Autonomous Many-task Simulator)
========

DReAMSim can be used to investigate the desired system scenario(s) for a particular scheduling strategy
and a given number of tasks, grid nodes, configurations, task arrival distribution, area ranges, tasks
required times etc.

The design offers to model complex reconfigurable computing nodes, processor configurations and tasks 
along with GPPs. A number of different reconfiguration parameters can be exploited to model the processor 
configurations. The framework is generic in nature and implemented in a modular way to allow further 
extensions in the future.
